## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. Test both common cases and edge cases.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors.

## 4. ML/AI Specific Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ scripts or tools like `dvc` to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
- **Model Versioning:** Utilize `git-lfs` or cloud storage to track and manage model checkpoints effectively.
- **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including parameters, results, and environmental details.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Dedicate a module or files for managing Prompt templates with version control.
- **Context Handling:** Implement efficient context management for conversations, using suitable data structures like deques.

## 4.1. RAG System Specific Guidelines

- **Document Processing:** Implement robust document parsing, chunking, and preprocessing pipelines.
- **Vector Store Management:** Use appropriate vector databases with proper indexing and similarity search optimization.
- **Retrieval Strategies:** Implement multiple retrieval strategies (semantic, keyword, hybrid) with configurable parameters.
- **Response Generation:** Ensure generated responses are grounded in retrieved context with proper citation.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Implement RAG-specific evaluation metrics (retrieval accuracy, answer relevance, faithfulness).
- **Chunking Strategies:** Use appropriate text chunking methods (semantic, fixed-size, sliding window) based on content type.
- **Embedding Management:** Cache embeddings efficiently and support multiple embedding models.
- **Query Processing:** Implement query expansion, reformulation, and preprocessing for better retrieval.

## 4.2. Reference Implementation

**Primary Reference:** All RAG system implementations should be based on the [langchain-teddynote](https://github.com/teddylee777/langchain-teddynote) repository.

### Key Components to Implement:

### Implementation Standards:

- Follow the exact API patterns and class structures from langchain-teddynote
- Use the same configuration patterns and parameter naming conventions
- Implement error handling and logging as demonstrated in the reference
- Maintain compatibility with the existing utility functions and classes
- Document all custom extensions and modifications clearly

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to maximize concurrency.
- **Caching:** Apply `functools.lru_cache`, `@cache` (Python 3.9+), or `fastapi.Depends` caching where appropriate.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Use `psutil` or similar to monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources to prevent memory leaks.
- **Concurrency:** Employ `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to manage concurrent tasks effectively.
- **Database Best Practices:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.

- **Security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
- **Documentation:** Auto-generate API documentation using FastAPI's OpenAPI support.
- **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., using URL prefixes or headers).
- **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings correctly.
